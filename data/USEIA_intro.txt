The U.S. Energy Information Administration is committed to enhancing the value of its free and open data by making it available through an Application Programming Interface (API) and open data tools to better serve our customers. The data in the API is also available in bulk file, in Excel via the add-in, in Google Sheets via an add-on, and via widgets that embed interactive data vizualizations of EIA data on any website. By making EIA data available in machine-readable formats, the creativity in the private, the non-profit, and the public sectors can be harnessed to find new ways to innovate and create value-added services powered by public data.

Currently, EIA's API contains the following main data sets:

Hourly electricity operating data, including actual and forecast demand, net generation, and the power flowing between electric systems
408,000 electricity series organized into 29,000 categories
30,000 State Energy Data System series organized into 600 categories
115,052 petroleum series and associated categories
34,790 U.S. crude imports series and associated categories
11,989 natural gas series and associated categories
132,331 coal series and associated categories
3,872 Short-Term Energy Outlook series and associated categories
368,466 Annual Energy Outlook series and associated categories
92,836 International energy series
The EIA API is offered as a free public service, although registration is required. Your registration and compliance with the API Terms of Service Agreement will help EIA monitor usage and ensure service availability. EIA data is provided free of charge and should be used in compliance with our Copyrights and Reuse page.
